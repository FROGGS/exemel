Exemel -- An Object-Oriented XML Framework for Perl 6

Status: Stable

Not much in the way of documentation yet, this is a simple XML parser
that creates objects with special attributes.

It supports element queries, parent element information, several types
of XML nodes (Document, Element, Text, PI, Comment, CDATA), a few helper
methods for working with XML Namespaces, and an extendable interface.

You can also serialize the objects back to text by using an Exemel object
in a string context.

I want to keep the core Exemel library slim and fast, with just the bare
essentials to work with common XML tasks. At the same time I want to be
able to provide some extra functionality that will make working with XML
documents easier and more fun. To that end, I am planning on including a
few additional helper libraries, see doc/TODO.txt for more information on 
the ones I'm currently planning.

See the tests in t/ for an example of how the library works.

The Exemel::Grammar library is based on the XML::Grammar::Document library
from http://github.com/krunen/xml but modified to work with the new Rakudo,
and some minor changes specific to the Exemel model.
