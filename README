Exemel -- An Object-Oriented XML Parser for Perl 6

Not much in the way of documentation yet, this is a simple XML parser
that creates objects with special attributes.

You can also serialize the objects back to text by using an Exemel object
in a string context.

More work coming along shortly to make this more useful, such as Query
plugins, which add new methods to the Exemel::Element class to make it
easy to find exactly what you are looking for.

See the tests in t/ for an example of how the library works.

The Exemel::Grammar library is based on the XML::Grammar::Document library
from http://github.com/krunen/xml but modified to work with the new Rakudo,
and some minor changes specific to the Exemel model.
