Exemel -- An Object-Oriented XML Framework for Perl 6

Not much in the way of documentation yet, this is a simple XML parser
that creates objects with special attributes.

You can also serialize the objects back to text by using an Exemel object
in a string context.

I'm planning on a couple of utility classes to make working with Exemel
even easier. See docs/TODO.txt for more information.

See the tests in t/ for an example of how the library works.

The Exemel::Grammar library is based on the XML::Grammar::Document library
from http://github.com/krunen/xml but modified to work with the new Rakudo,
and some minor changes specific to the Exemel model.
